# F25D Task 2

This is a simple resume page I made as the second task in my Frontend Development class.
I've purposefully used only HTML and CSS this time, as we're building upon this and including javascript in task 3.

###### The HTML validates with no errors or warnings at validator.w3.org (there are some info messages regarding the traling slash /> on self closing tags that Prettier adds that i found annoying, but i learned that it isn't a problem and just info in case they were used for the wrong reason. Even code examples at MDN web docs use the trailing slashes and Prettier as formatter)
